# ASR Project Overview

## Project Background

The ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) project is an intelligent voice interaction assistant built with modern AI technologies. This system combines speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities to provide a comprehensive voice interaction solution.

## Core Vision

To create a robust, scalable, and efficient voice interaction system that can:
- Accurately transcribe speech to text using state-of-the-art models
- Generate natural-sounding speech from text
- Provide real-time voice processing capabilities
- Support multiple languages and accents

## Main Goals

1. **High Accuracy Speech Recognition**: Utilize Faster-Whisper for accurate speech-to-text conversion
2. **Natural Text-to-Speech**: Implement Coqui TTS for high-quality voice synthesis
3. **Real-time Processing**: Provide low-latency voice processing for interactive applications
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Design a modular system that can handle multiple concurrent requests
5. **Easy Integration**: Offer RESTful APIs for seamless integration with other applications

## Problems Solved

- **Language Barriers**: Enable voice interaction in multiple languages
- **Accessibility**: Provide voice interfaces for users with visual impairments
- **Efficiency**: Automate voice-based tasks and interactions
- **User Experience**: Create natural and intuitive voice interfaces

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI for high-performance API development
- **Speech Recognition**: Faster-Whisper for accurate and fast transcription
- **Text-to-Speech**: Coqui TTS for natural voice synthesis
- **Audio Processing**: FFmpeg, librosa, and soundfile for audio manipulation
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent deployment environments
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus for metrics and health monitoring
